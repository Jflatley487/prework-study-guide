# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for building this webpage was to consolidate all of the information learned from the bootcamp prework for easy access and reference. It solves the problem of being overwhelmed by so much data, making it difficult to recall. By building the Prework Study Guide Webpage, I learned how to implement HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as use GitHub and my own computer's terminal.
